// The EmailManager class has a public method (sendMail()) that sends email and uses built-in Messaging methods of the Apex class library
//  Also, this class has a private helper method (inspectResults()), which canâ€™t be called externally because it is private but is used only within the class. This helper method inspects the results of the email send call and is called by sendMail().
